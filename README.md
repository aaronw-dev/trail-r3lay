## What am I making?
I'm creating a radio relay tower that runs on 915 MHz and uses my own communications protocol. It will act as a communications point where all LoRa devices on the Trail can send and receive data.

## Inspiration
I was inspired by the design and rapid deployment capability Anduril's Sentry tower.
